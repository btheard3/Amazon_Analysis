## Machine Learning Models
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Simple and interpretable but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: More robust, handles non-linear data well.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**: Effective for simpler datasets with fewer dimensions.
- **Comparison**: RMSE values are calculated for each model to identify the best performer.
